# Facebook Promo Posts for QuoteSnap

## Post 1: Tradie Facebook Groups (Brisbane Tradies, Aussie Tradies, etc.)

**Post:**
👋 Hey legends — built a free tool that tells you if you're charging the right hourly rate for your trade.

Takes 30 seconds:
✅ Pick your trade (plumber, sparky, chippie, landscaper, etc.)
✅ Select your area (all AU states)  
✅ See where you sit vs market rates

No signup, no email needed, just straight answers.

I've been chatting with tradies and most blokes haven't checked their rate in 2+ years. Material costs went up 15% but rates stayed the same. Time to find out if you're leaving money on the table 💰

Let me know if the rates feel right for your area — keen to hear what you reckon!

## Post 2: Small Business Owner Groups

**Post:**
Question for tradies and service business owners:

How long does it take you to create and send a quote after visiting a job site?

I've been talking to tradies and the average is 2-3 HOURS after getting home. Meanwhile, the customer has already called 3 other tradies and the first one to send a quote usually wins the job.

I'm working on a solution — an app where you snap a photo of the job on-site and it generates a professional quote in about 60 seconds. Still building it, but keen to hear if this would save you time.

In the meantime, I made a free rate calculator if you want to check if you're charging what you're worth: https://quotesnap-app.netlify.app/#calculator

What's the biggest time-waster in your quoting process? 👇

## Posting Strategy
1. Post 1 in 3-5 tradie Facebook groups (Brisbane-focused first, then national)
2. Post 2 in small business owner groups after 24-48 hours
3. Be genuine in comments — answer questions, don't hard sell
4. If anyone asks about the app, direct them to the waitlist
