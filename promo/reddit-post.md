## Post 1: r/AustralianTrades or r/AusElectricians (Value-first approach)

**Title:** I built a free tool to check if you're charging the right hourly rate for your trade

**Body:**
Hey everyone,

I've been talking to a lot of tradies lately about quoting and pricing, and the same thing keeps coming up — most of you have no idea if your hourly rate is actually competitive for your area.

So I built a free Tradie Rate Calculator. Takes 30 seconds:

1. Pick your trade
2. Select your region (all Australian states/territories)
3. Enter your years of experience and current rate

It shows you where you sit compared to market rates, your percentile ranking, and tips to charge more if you're undercharging.

**Link:** https://quotesnap-app.netlify.app/#calculator

It covers plumbing, electrical, carpentry, landscaping, painting, building, cleaning, HVAC, and roofing.

No signup required, completely free, no catch. Built it because I reckon tradies deserve to know their market value.

Would love feedback on whether the rates feel accurate for your area. Cheers!

## Post 2: r/smallbusiness (Problem-focused approach)

**Title:** Tradies: how long do you spend on quotes each week? (Trying to solve this)

**Body:**
Running a small trades business and I've always hated the quoting process. Go look at a job, take some mental notes, then spend the evening at the kitchen table typing up quotes. Half of them don't even convert.

I talked to about 30 tradies and the average was 8-10 hours per week on quoting alone. The worst part? The jobs that DO convert often go to whoever quotes first — not who quotes best.

I'm building a tool called QuoteSnap that lets you snap a photo of the job and generates a professional quote with materials and labour pricing in about 60 seconds. The idea is you can send it before you leave the site.

Still early days, but I also built a free rate calculator if anyone wants to check if they're charging market rate for their area: https://quotesnap-app.netlify.app/#calculator

Anyone else frustrated with how long quoting takes? What would make it easier for you?

## Post 3: r/sweatystartup (Builder/entrepreneur angle)

**Title:** Building a micro-SaaS for tradies — here's the pain point I found

**Body:**
Been researching pain points for trades businesses (plumbers, electricians, landscapers etc) and the #1 complaint across the board is **quoting**.

The data:
- Average tradie spends 8-10 hours/week on quotes
- First to quote wins ~60% of jobs
- Most tradies are undercharging by 10-20% because they haven't checked market rates in years
- Existing tools (Tradify, ServiceM8) are full CRM suites at $30-50/mo — overkill when you just want faster quoting

So I'm building **QuoteSnap** — AI-powered quoting from your phone. Take a photo, add a voice note if you want, and get a professional branded PDF quote in 60 seconds.

As a free lead magnet, I built a Tradie Rate Calculator that shows where your hourly rate sits vs market: https://quotesnap-app.netlify.app/#calculator

Early stages — collecting waitlist signups now. Would love feedback from anyone who's built for trades/home services.
