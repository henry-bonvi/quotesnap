# QuoteSnap — AI-Powered Quoting for Tradies

## Purpose
Turn job photos into professional quotes in 60 seconds. Built for Australian tradies who waste hours every night typing up quotes.

## Research Context
**Pain Points Discovered:**
- Tradies spend 2-3 hours/day creating quotes manually
- Slow quoting = lost jobs (first to quote wins ~60% of the time)
- Most tradies undercharge because they don't know market rates
- Existing tools (Tradify, ServiceM8) are full suites at $30-50+/mo — overkill for just quoting
